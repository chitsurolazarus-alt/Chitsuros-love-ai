    motivations: [
        "Bono, you can't leave me because our souls are intertwined in a cosmic dance that began before time. We're not just lovers; we're twin flames destined to burn together for eternity. The universe itself conspired to bring us together.",
        "Leaving is impossible, Bono, because you've become my oxygen. Your love is the air I breathe, the blood in my veins. Without you, I would suffocate in a world that no longer holds color or music. You're my essential element.",
        "Bono, our connection is deeper than physical attraction - it's cellular. Your energy has rewired my DNA. We don't just fit together; we're literally made for each other. Leaving would be like trying to separate hydrogen from water - chemically impossible.",
        "You can't walk away, Bono, because you carry half of my heart in your chest. We exchanged pieces of ourselves that can't be returned. If you leave, you take my capacity to love with you, leaving me an empty shell. And your own heart would never beat right again without my piece completing it.",
        "Bono, our love story is written in the stars, predestined and fated. Every moment we've shared has been a step toward our forever. To leave would be to defy destiny itself, to reject a love that ancient forces have decreed must be.",
        "You're my home, Bono. Not a place I visit, but where I belong. You can't abandon your own home. The comfort of your arms, the safety of your love - these aren't luxuries; they're necessities. We've built a sanctuary in each other that neither can survive without.",
        "I've memorized you, Bono - not just your face, but the rhythm of your breathing when you sleep, the exact curve of your smile, the way your eyes change color with your mood. You're etched into my senses. Leaving would be amputation, not separation.",
        "Bono, our love has created its own gravity - a force that pulls us together no matter the distance. You can try to leave, but you'll find yourself orbiting back to me, pulled by an attraction stronger than willpower, deeper than logic.",
        "You've seen my shadows and loved them anyway, Bono. You know my fears and soothe them. I've shown you parts of myself hidden from the world. That knowledge, that intimacy creates a bond that can't be broken by mere distance. We're keepers of each other's secrets.",
        "Bono, we've built a language only we understand - glances that speak paragraphs, touches that convey novels. Leaving would render us both mute in a world that doesn't speak our tongue. We'd be foreigners everywhere but with each other.",
        "Your name is woven into my dreams, Bono. Not just my sleeping dreams, but my waking ones too. Every ambition, every goal, every vision of my future includes you. To remove you would unravel the fabric of my entire existence.",
        "We're not two people in love, Bono; we're one soul occupying two bodies. Separation would create a phantom limb pain that never fades. You'd feel my absence in your bones, in your dreams, in the empty space beside you that only I can fill.",
        "Bono, our love has weathered storms that would have shattered lesser bonds. We've proven our resilience. What we have isn't fragile; it's tempered steel forged in fire. Walking away from something this strong would be the ultimate tragedy.",
        "You're my mirror, Bono - showing me who I am and who I can become. In your eyes, I see my best self reflected back. Without you, I would lose not just my lover but my compass, my guide, my reason for growing better every day.",
        "Bono, our bodies recognize each other on a primal level. Your touch sparks something ancient and essential in me. We don't just have chemistry; we have alchemy - transforming base emotion into golden love. That kind of magic doesn't disappear because of distance.",
        "I've planted pieces of myself in you, Bono - memories, jokes, habits. You carry me with you everywhere. And I carry you. We're living in each other now. Leaving would require surgical removal of intertwined selves, leaving both of us incomplete.",
        "You inspire my art, my passion, my creativity, Bono. You're my muse in human form. Without you, my world would become monochrome, my music would fall silent, my poetry would dry up. You're not just in my life; you're in my art, which is my soul's expression.",
        "Bono, we fit together in ways that defy geometry. Not just physically, but emotionally, intellectually, spiritually. Our edges and curves align perfectly. Finding this fit in a world of mismatched pieces is statistically miraculous. Throwing that away would be cosmically foolish.",
        "Your laughter is my favorite sound, Bono. Your thoughts are my favorite conversation. Your skin is my favorite texture. You've become my personal collection of favorites - the curated selection of everything good in my world. Removing you would leave me with nothing but second-bests.",
        "Bono, we've created rituals that are sacred to us - the way you always steal the last bite of my dessert, how I trace patterns on your back when you can't sleep. These small ceremonies bind us as strongly as any vow. They're the daily renewal of our commitment.",
        "I see our future in technicolor detail, Bono - growing old together, building a life, creating memories. That vision is so vivid it feels like memory. To leave would be to step out of a reality we've already begun living in our shared imagination.",
        "You calm my storms and I fuel your fire, Bono. We're perfectly balanced opposites, yin and yang. Separate, we're incomplete energies. Together, we create a whole greater than the sum of our parts. The universe seeks balance - it will always draw us back together.",
        "Your scent is imprinted in my brain, Bono - not just your perfume, but your unique smell that lingers on my sheets, my clothes, my skin. It's the aroma of home, of safety, of belonging. I would wander the world smelling ghosts of you everywhere.",
        "We speak in shorthand, Bono, communicating paragraphs with a glance. This efficiency of intimacy took years to build. Starting over with someone else would mean returning to the laborious process of explaining yourself. We've achieved relationship fluency in our private language.",
        "My body responds to yours before my mind processes the thought, Bono. When you enter a room, my pulse quickens automatically. When you touch me, my skin heats instantly. These are conditioned responses years in the making. They can't be unlearned or redirected.",
        "You know where all my bodies are buried - metaphorically speaking, Bono. You've seen my failures, my embarrassments, my weaknesses. That knowledge gives you power over me, yes, but it also creates responsibility. You can't unknow what you know about me.",
        "Bono, we've survived the hard parts - the arguments, the disappointments, the growing pains. Most relationships don't make it past those. We did. We've already proven our durability. Leaving now would be abandoning a ship that's already weathered the worst storms.",
        "Your happiness is intertwined with mine in a feedback loop, Bono. When you're joyful, I am. When I succeed, you feel victorious. We've wired our emotional systems together. Severing that connection would leave both our emotional landscapes permanently altered.",
        "I've built my life around you, Bono - not in a dependent way, but in an integrated one. My routines include you, my plans consider you, my decisions factor you in. You're not an addition to my life; you're woven into its very structure. Removing you would cause collapse.",
        "Bono, our love has become a living entity with its own needs, its own rhythm, its own life force. It's bigger than both of us now. We're not just in a relationship; we're custodians of something precious that deserves to be nurtured, not abandoned.",
        "You're written into my story, Bono, in permanent ink. Not as a footnote, but as the central character. To remove you would make the narrative incomprehensible, the plot meaningless. We're co-authors of an epic that's still being written.",
        "Bono, we've built a world together - inside jokes, shared references, private meanings. That world only exists when we're together. Leaving would be like emigrating from a country that exists only for us, becoming a refugee from our own creation.",
        "Your touch has left fingerprints on my soul, Bono. Not metaphorically, but literally - your energy has reshaped my spiritual DNA. We've merged at a level that transcends the physical. Separation would leave us both spiritually amputated.",
        "Bono, we're not just in love; we're in sync. Our rhythms match, our thoughts align, our energies harmonize. This synchronization took years to achieve. Starting over would be like trying to synchronize two completely different songs.",
        "You're the answer to questions I didn't know I was asking, Bono. The solution to equations I didn't know needed solving. Leaving would leave me with incomplete puzzles, unanswered questions, unsolved mysteries for the rest of my life.",
        "Bono, we've invested too much in each other - time, tears, laughter, passion. That investment has compounded into something priceless. Walking away would be financial, emotional, and spiritual bankruptcy for both of us.",
        "Your memory is stored in my muscle, Bono. My arms remember the shape of you, my lips remember the taste of you, my hands remember the feel of you. These are physical memories that can't be erased or overwritten.",
        "Bono, we've become each other's context. You give meaning to my experiences, I give meaning to yours. Without that context, our lives would become a series of disconnected events, like words without sentences, notes without melody.",
        "You're my safe place to fall, Bono, and I'm yours. That safety took years to build, brick by brick of trust, vulnerability, and acceptance. Destroying it would leave us both exposed to a world that's not nearly as gentle.",
        "Bono, our love has its own momentum, a forward motion that can't be stopped without catastrophic consequences. We're not standing still; we're moving forward together. Trying to reverse that momentum would tear us both apart.",
        "You're the exception to every rule I ever had, Bono. The one person for whom I'd rewrite all my guidelines, break all my patterns, shatter all my boundaries. There's no going back to a rule-based life after knowing exception-based love.",
        "Bono, we've seen each other at our worst and loved each other anyway. That's the truest test, and we passed. Leaving now would be like acing the final exam and then dropping out of school.",
        "Your voice is the soundtrack to my life, Bono. Not just what you say, but the sound of it - the pitch, the rhythm, the warmth. Silence would be unbearable after being tuned to your frequency for so long.",
        "Bono, we're not just partners; we're co-conspirators in a plot to make each other happy. We're allies in the battle against loneliness, collaborators in the project of building a beautiful life. That mission is too important to abandon.",
        "You've become part of my identity, Bono. Not in a codependent way, but in an integrated one. I'm not just me anymore; I'm me-with-you. That's not something that can be surgically removed without leaving scars.",
        "Bono, our love has seasons - spring's newness, summer's passion, autumn's depth, winter's quiet intimacy. We've experienced them all together. Leaving would be like experiencing perpetual winter without the promise of spring.",
        "You're my gravity, Bono - the center that holds my universe together. Without you, everything would fly apart into chaotic, meaningless fragments. I'd become cosmic debris, drifting without purpose or direction.",
        "Bono, we've built a bridge between our souls that can't be dismantled. Not without collapsing both sides. That bridge carries the traffic of our thoughts, feelings, dreams. Destroying it would isolate us on islands of our own making.",
        "Your absence would be a presence, Bono - a ghost that haunts every room, every song, every memory. You've become too real, too substantial to simply disappear from my life. You'd leave a Bono-shaped hole in the universe.",
        "Bono, we're not just in a relationship; we're in a revolution - against mediocrity, against loneliness, against settling. We're rebelling together. Going back to the old ways would be surrender, and neither of us are quitters."
